 <!-- Below is a content delivery network (CDN) also called 
 content distribution network, it is a group of geographically
 distributed and interconnected servers. They provide cached 
 internet content from a network location closes to a user

<!--initialize the name variable using ng-init, this is used for 
demonstrative and testing purposes only. When building an actual 
application, controllers should initialize the data.
The next 3 steps establish the two way data-binding, changes made to 
the input update the model, which is reflected in the view-->
<body ng-init="name='World'">
 <label>Name</label>
 <!--Bind data from the model to view on HTML controls. Bind an 
 <input> to the name poperty with ng-model.-->
 <input ng-model="name" />
 <!--Display content from the model using double braces "{{ }}"-->
 <span>Hello, {{ name }}!</span>
 <p ng-bind="name"></p>
</body>
</html>

<!-- if you use handle bars there is a chance that you see Hello, {{name}}
as the page loads before the expressiion is resolved (before the data)
is loaded-->

<!-- if you use ng-bind, it will only show the data when the name is 
resolve. As an alternative the directive ng-cloak can be used to 
prevent handlebars to display before compiled -->
